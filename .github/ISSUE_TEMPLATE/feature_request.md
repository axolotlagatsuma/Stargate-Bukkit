**Feature use case**
In SG, is there any behaviour someone may wish for that is not accommodated as-is?
What problem are you trying to solve and who does this problem most frequently impact?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen, including any new behaviour.

**Philosophy**
Is this behaviour philosophy compliant? If so, how?

> SG's core features follow the Dinnerbone Philosophy:
> "End-users in survival mode must be able to fully interact with all features of the plugin through the course of their game-play and without breaking immersion".

If your suggested behaviour falls outside of this philosophy, please instead consider:
- [Suggesting a modular mechanic](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Mechanics)
  - Functionality that requires breaking mechanical immersion, for example, requiring users to program gate behaviour with text inputs.
- [Suggesting a modular interface](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Interfaces)
  - Functionality that requires breaking interface immersion, for example, requiring a user to interact with a portal through commands and/or chat.
- [Suggesting a modular interlinkage](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Customizations/issues/new)
  - Functionality that requires breaking gameplay continuity by requiring interaction with an external resource (for example, a website).
