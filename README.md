Stargate-Bukkit is the original MineCraft portal plugin; it has existed for as long as MineCraft server modding has been
feasible!

The project was originally conceived and developed by Dinnerbone, who eventually went on to develop for Bukkit and
Mojang.<br> In 2011, Dinnerbone authorized the community to continue his work; since then, SG has been maintained by
dozens of individual devs!

In 2021 the project was rewritten by Thorinwasher and EpicKnarvik97; this is that rewrite.
