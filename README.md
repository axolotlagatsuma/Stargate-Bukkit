Stargate-Bukkit is the original MineCraft portal plugin; it existed for as long as MineCraft server modding has been feasible!

The project was originally conceived and developed by Dinnerbone, who eventually went on to develop for Bukkit and Mojang.
In 2011, Dinnerbone authorized the community to continue his work; since then, the project has been maintained by dozens of individual developers.

In 2021 the project was rewritten by Thorinwasher and EpicKnarvik97; this is that rewrite.
